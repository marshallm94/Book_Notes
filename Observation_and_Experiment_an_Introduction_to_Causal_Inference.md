Page 271: "...Do high-level NICU's save more lives?"

* This is a question that is a clear example of the need to ensure that
one is comparing two things that are indeed comparable. Right off the bat, I
could see how an un-inquisitive investigator, if he did not use matching techniques,
could come up with an answer of "No, high level NICU's do not save more lives. In
fact, it appears that high level NICU's 'lose' more lives."
	* I think it is safe to assume that, if a mother and father know they
	are going to have a baby born premature (perhaps with more complications
	than a baby that is born less premature), they might go out of their way
	to seek out a NICU with a higher rating. This could then lead to the average
	acuity of babies in highly rated NICU's being well above the average acuity
	of babies in lower rated NICU's. Matching for acuity level (weeks premature,
	genetic complications, etc) would be the minimum needed to ensure comparability.
