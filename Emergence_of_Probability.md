* (page 32): "The evidence of things is different from the testimony, the evidence of witness and authorities. Probably
  Austin did not mention witnesses because they seem parasitic on the evidence of things. We rely on them when we can
  not be at the scene ourselves. We use authorities when we are ignorant. People and books, whether they be authorities
  or chance witnesses, seem to stand in place of ourselves. They report on evidence that they have been able to acquire,
  and so it seems to us that they are not the basic kind of evidence."

  The substance of this paragraph touches on different types of knowlegde as well. There is a difference between reading
  a mathematics textbook and taking the concepts for granted because the author of said textbook has a published
  mathematics textbook and therefore must know what he is talking about, and reading a mathematics textbook and
  **playing with the concepts yourself**. Putting them to the test, seeing where the fail, et cetera.
